Restitched is an up-coming game developed by Trixel Creative. It is a 2.5D platformer for PC with a robust level editor and support for UGC using Steam Workshop. I have been working on the game with Trixel since September 2021 and have been lead programmer of the game since April 2022. I have written a substantial portion of the game, including many level editing tools, most of the game’s user interface, and all of the Steam Workshop integration. I am also the primary maintainer of TrixelAudio, an open-source Unity package that’s also used as the Restitched audio system.

## Things I've done
My work as lead programmer of the game has helped me:

 - Improve my communication skills working with and leading a medium-sized team
 - Learn advanced concepts such as reactive programming and asynchronous programming
 - Improve my debugging and unit testing skills
 - Learn how to better-manage my time and prevent burnout

Many of my contributions to the game include:

 - Workshop support: Browsing, playing, and publishing user-created levels
 - Editing tools: Ornaments, Logic, Level Notes, Multi-Select, World Merging
 - UI: Main Menu, Pause Menu, Settings Panels, Workshop Overlay, Message Dialogs, and Custom Cursors
 - Gameplay: Checkpoints, Play Mode, Hazards and Death
 - 3D physics support
 - Controller support in the Craftbook and other user interface elements
 - QA on Linux, macOS, and Steam Deck
